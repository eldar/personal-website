I am a postdoctoral researcher in the [Visual Geometry Group](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) at the University of Oxford working with [Prof. Andrea Vedaldi](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vedaldi/) and [Dr. Joao Henriques](https://eng.ox.ac.uk/people/joao-henriques/). My primary research interest is in self-supervised learning of visual representations for novel view synthesis and acquisition of 3D assets from raw in-the-wild data. I completed my PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics under the supervision of [Prof. Bernt Schiele](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/computer-vision-and-machine-learning/people/bernt-schiele). During the course of my doctoral studies I have been working on the problem of human pose estimation in unconstrained scenes and unsupervised learning of 3D representations. I had the pleasure to do an internship at the Intelligent Systems Lab at Intel working with Alexey Dosovitskiy. I obtained my master's degree in Visual Computing from the Saarland University.
